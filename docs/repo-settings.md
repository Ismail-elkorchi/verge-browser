# Repository settings

## Dependabot update policy

- Group npm and GitHub Actions version updates.
- Set `open-pull-requests-limit: 1` per ecosystem for version updates.
- Treat security updates as a separate channel from version updates.

## Security updates note

Dependabot security updates are managed independently from grouped version updates and may open up to the platform security-update queue limit.
